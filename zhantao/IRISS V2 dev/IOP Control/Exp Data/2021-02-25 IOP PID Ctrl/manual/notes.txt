data 9:
port up, no visco
60 cm H2O bottle height
[kp,kd,ki] = [1,0,1]

Remarks
1. sensor on top, and the opening faces downward if it's of bevel tip
   tool at the bottom, and port faces upwards emulating polishing confiuration
2. if the anterior chamber is filled with visco, the response will be slow,
   and the controller gains need to be high (espeicially kp)
   recommended gains:
	a. no visco: kp = 1, kd = 0, ki = 5;
	b. with visco: kp = 5, kd = 0, ki = 5;
